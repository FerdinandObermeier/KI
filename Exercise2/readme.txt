Choice of variables = I chose to assign:

- The number 1 to the variable risk
- The number 2 to the variable scrabble
- The number 3 to the variable UNO
- The number 4 to the variable lego

- A matrix consisting of 8 entries to the variable "teams".
The entries correspond to the players, so entry:
> 1 is the entry for Andrea
> 2 is the entry for Beatrix
> 3 is the entry for Celeste
> 4 is the entry for David
> 5 is the entry for Emanuel
> 6 is the entry for Frank
> 7 is the entry for George
> 8 is the entry for Hilary.

Each entry can take an int between 0 and 4, where:
+ 0 indicates, that no game is played
+ 1 indicates, that risk is played
+ 2 indicates, that scrabble is played
+ 3 indicates, that uno is played
+ 4 indicates, that lego is played

So for example, if entry 5 of the teams matrix is 3, this means, that Emanuel is playing uno.
